\chapter{Discussion}

In this study, overtaking maneuvers were captured as independent events by stationary drones, without the ability to track individual cyclists across multiple occurrences. As a result, clustering analysis of overtaking cannot reveal persistent cyclist-specific behavior (“styles”), but only transient maneuver types. Our results confirm this: clusters reliably distinguish between active, interaction-driven overtakes and passive, free-flow overtakes, yet these clusters reflect event-level modes rather than enduring behavioral regimes. In contrast, following behavior is continuous within a trajectory and can be clustered into regimes, such as “close, reactive” versus “far, stable” following, because it exhibits persistent patterns over time. This distinction highlights a fundamental methodological limitation: regime-level analyses require repeated observations of the same agent, which is not available for overtaking in the current dataset.
