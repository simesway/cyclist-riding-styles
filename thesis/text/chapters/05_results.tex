\subsection{Overtaking}
For volatile riding regimes, the ECDF of $distance_traffic_light$ exhibits a pronounced knee at approximately 20 m. 
This transition aligns with prior findings indicating that cyclist behavior is influenced by traffic lights within a ~20 m range, suggesting that this distance marks a behaviorally relevant regime boundary for volatile riders. 
visual attention and environmental scanning intensify as cyclists enter <35m from the signal \cite{rupi_visual_2019}, aswell as cyclists tend to decelerate/accelerate within 30 m of a stop line at signalised intersections \cite{haifeng_research_2013}
